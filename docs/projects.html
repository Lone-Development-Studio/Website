                        Lone Development Discord Bot is bot that moderates the Lone Development discord server.
                        Although many features I plan to add to the bot are already available by other bots,
                        those features are generalized and not specific enough for what I want the
                        Lone Development Bot to be able to do. Once complete the Lone Development bot could
						completely run the Lone Development Discord Server without needing me to moderate its actions.

                    <p>
                        Technology is at the point in which we could control every aspect of the house with our phones.
                        But many smart home device manufactures have to accommodate so many different scenarios that
                        smart home devices are not in every aspect of the home. <br/> Like seen in many futuristic movies this
                        project serves to try and add a micro controller to every aspect of the home.
                        <br/><br/>Just so that all the devices I design are compatible and buildable, I will make and install all
                        of the device within my own home.  <br/>All the code and model files will be listed within the github repo.
                        There will most likely be many revisions to all the devices as well developing a new device,
                        I might add more features to an exiting device.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        This Project could range as far as fully functioning
                        fridges that can tell you what is in it at any given time to a custom built wall that houses
                        displays on both sides. The Complexity of the system might reach a point where the amount of data
                        available to all the device so much that a I would probably need to build custom network routing system.

                    <p class="heading">Planatary Survivor</p>
                    <p>
						After crash landing on a alien planet your job as the player is to either survive or thrive.
                        <br/>
                        Survival is the basic principal of the game. While playing the game the play can become very
                        well established that they could survive on the planet for longer than the need to, thus they
                        are thriving on the planet.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Crashland...Escape, seems like most survival games, well Planatary Survivor aims to cater to most
                        choices the player could make.<br/>
                        If the player wants to build in space they can, else if they want to build on the planet they can.
                        Being as flexable as possible is what I will strive to achive with this game.
